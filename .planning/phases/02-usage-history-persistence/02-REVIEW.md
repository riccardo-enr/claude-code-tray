# Phase 02: Code Review Report

**Reviewed:** 2026-07-12T09:57:13Z
**Depth:** standard
**Files Reviewed:** 1
**Status:** issues_found

## Summary

Reviewed the Phase 02 additions to `claude-monitor.py` (diff `d333371^..HEAD`, +137
lines): history constants, the pure functions `history_record` / `history_keep` /
`parse_history`, the defensive I/O pair `append_history` / `prune_history`, and the
`poll_loop` wiring.

The core mechanics are sound. The atomic-prune is done correctly: the temp file is
created via `tempfile.mkstemp(dir=os.path.dirname(HISTORY_PATH))` in the SAME
directory as the target, `os.replace` is used (atomic, same-filesystem), the original
is never truncated in place, and the `finally` block cleans up a leftover temp file on
the failure path with `tmp = None` correctly gating cleanup after a successful replace.
File-descriptor handling via `with os.fdopen(fd, "w")` closes the fd on both success and
error. All history I/O runs on the `poll_loop` daemon thread (append at line 541, prune
at 536/545), never in `apply_usage` or on the Gtk main loop — the thread/GTK boundary
contract holds. `history_record` correctly pins `t = int(now)` and stores `burn` raw
per-minute. The self-check in `demo()` exercises record/retention/parse. Style matches
the pre-existing v1.0 code (guarded-int env pattern, codedoc docstrings, ASCII-only).

The one substantive concern is a completeness gap between the stated defensive-I/O
contract ("never crashes ... reader skips corrupt lines") and the actual exception
handling in `prune_history`: several non-`OSError` exception classes can escape it and
kill the long-lived poll thread. Details below.

## Warnings

### WR-01: `prune_history` swallows only `OSError`, but its read+filter path can raise `UnicodeDecodeError` / `TypeError` / `KeyError`, escaping the handler and killing the `poll_loop` daemon thread

**File:** `claude-monitor.py:206-232` (specifically the `try` body at 216-224)

**Issue:** The phase's defensive contract is that a corrupt/partial store must never
crash or block the poll thread — `parse_history` was built to skip unparseable lines
for exactly this reason. But `prune_history` guards only `except OSError`, while two
reachable failure modes on a corrupted store raise non-`OSError` exceptions that
propagate out of `prune_history` and terminate `poll_loop` (called directly at lines
536 and 545, not inside any broader handler):

1. `open(HISTORY_PATH)` + `f.read()` (line 216) decodes as text with the default codec.
   A store containing invalid UTF-8 bytes raises `UnicodeDecodeError`, which is a
   subclass of `ValueError`, NOT `OSError` (confirmed).
2. `parse_history` is tolerant only at the *line* level: it returns whatever valid JSON
   each line yields, including non-dict scalars. A line that is valid JSON but not a
   record (`null`, `42`, `"hi"`, `[1,2]`, `1e999`) survives parsing, and then
   `history_keep(rec, now, days)` evaluates `rec["t"]` (line 172), raising `TypeError`;
   a dict line missing `"t"` raises `KeyError`. Both confirmed non-`OSError`.

Consequence: once the poll thread dies, usage monitoring silently stops for the rest of
the process lifetime — no more polls, no more history appended, no more pruning, and no
visible error (daemon thread, exception goes to stderr at most). This is precisely the
"raised exception kills the long-lived poll_loop thread" failure the review brief calls
out, and it defeats the tolerance `parse_history` was written to provide.

Reachability note: the tool's own writes are ASCII (`json.dumps` defaults to
`ensure_ascii=True`) dict lines, and a killed-mid-write append yields an *invalid* JSON
prefix (skipped), so this is not reachable from normal operation — it requires external
corruption / bit-rot / a third party writing to the file. That keeps it a WARNING rather
than a BLOCKER, but the whole point of this phase is surviving exactly such corruption,
so the gap is worth closing.

**Fix:** Make the tolerance total. Two small, independent hardenings:

```python
def parse_history(text):
    out = []
    for line in text.splitlines():
        line = line.strip()
        if not line:
            continue
        try:
            rec = json.loads(line)
        except Exception:
            continue
        # only keep well-formed records so downstream rec["t"] can't raise
        if isinstance(rec, dict) and "t" in rec:
            out.append(rec)
    return out
```

and read bytes tolerantly so non-UTF8 content can't raise on decode:

```python
    try:
        with open(HISTORY_PATH, encoding="utf-8", errors="replace") as f:
            records = parse_history(f.read())
        ...
    except OSError:
        return
```

Filtering in `parse_history` (rather than only broadening the `except`) also protects
Phase 03's readers, which the docstring says reuse this function.

## Info

### IN-01: History parent directory (`~/.claude`) is never created; a missing dir silently disables all persistence

**File:** `claude-monitor.py:193-204` (`append_history`), `56` (`HISTORY_PATH`)

**Issue:** `append_history` opens `HISTORY_PATH` in append mode and swallows `OSError`.
If `~/.claude` does not exist, every append raises `FileNotFoundError` (an `OSError`),
is swallowed, and history never persists — with no signal to the user. In practice
`~/.claude` is the Claude Code config dir and effectively always exists, so this is
low-impact, but the silent-no-op means a genuinely missing dir is undiagnosable.

**Fix:** Best-effort create the dir once (e.g. at startup in `poll_loop`, before the
first prune): `os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(HISTORY_PATH), exist_ok=True)` inside a
`try/except OSError`. Keep it on the poll thread to preserve the GTK-boundary contract.

### IN-02: `history_keep` boundary is inclusive but the docstring says "strictly older ... are dropped"

**File:** `claude-monitor.py:166-172`

**Issue:** Minor doc/behavior wording mismatch. The predicate is
`rec["t"] >= now - days*86400`, so a record exactly `days*86400` seconds old is *kept*.
The docstring says records "strictly older than `days` are dropped," which is consistent
with the `>=` (equal-age is not strictly older, so kept), but "strictly older" can read
ambiguously against an inclusive bound. Behavior is fine for retention; no functional
bug. Optionally tighten the docstring to "records older than `days` (exclusive of the
exact boundary) are dropped" for clarity.

**Fix:** Documentation-only; adjust wording or leave as-is.
